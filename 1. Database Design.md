# Database Design

---

## What's the most important part of a website?

- The front-end (website)
- The back-end (server)
- The users
- The data

The answer:

- **The data**

## Relational Databases

- Table
    - Where the information is stored
- Columns
    - Defines what the type of information is stored
- Rows
    - An entry in the database
- Data / Entry
    - The information being stored

## Relational Databases

### Primary Key

- PK
- Indexes things in the database
- Unique (no matter what)
- Quick fetching

Posts:

|  PK   |              Name              |
| :---: | :----------------------------: |
|   1   | An apple keeps the doctor away |
|   3   |            Post #3             |

DELETED: | 2 | Why doctors are afraid of apples?|

‚ùóWe deleted Row #2 and added a new row, which has a PK of 3.
